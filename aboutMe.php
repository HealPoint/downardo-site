<h1><b>About Me!</b></h1>
<hr/>
<p>
I'm a 16-year-old developer living in Vienna, Austria. Currently I spend my day working as Lead Developer for some projects. I'm also available for smaller, interesting projects during evenings and weekends.
</p>
<p>
I spend my days with my hands in many different areas of development from back end programming to front end engineering.
</p>
<p>
I'm extremely passionate about development in all it's forms and helping small businesses and artists to build and improve their online presence.
